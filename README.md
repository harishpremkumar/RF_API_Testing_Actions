# Automated API Testing with Robot Framework

This GitHub Actions workflow automates API testing using Robot Framework. It runs tests on push events to the `main` branch and generates detailed reports.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Ensure Repository Setup**:
   - Make sure your repository contains the necessary API test cases and configurations under the appropriate directories.

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
     - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Required for GitHub Actions to interact with the GitHub API and upload/download artifacts.

3. **Workflow Configuration**:
   - The workflow configuration is defined in `.github/workflows/blank.yaml`. Ensure this file exists and is correctly configured with your specific test suite paths and dependencies.

## Running the Workflow

1. **Push to `main` Branch**:
   - Once everything is set up, simply push your changes to the `main` branch.

2. **Monitor Workflow Execution**:
   - Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the execution of the workflow.
   - You'll see logs indicating the progress of each step, including test execution and artifact uploads.

3. **Accessing Test Reports**:
   - After the workflow completes, navigate to the "Artifacts" section of the workflow run in the Actions tab.
   - Download the `reports` artifact to access detailed test reports generated by Robot Framework.

## Customization Options

- **Python and Robot Framework Versions**:
  - Modify the `python-version` and `rf-version` matrix variables in the workflow file (`api-testing.yaml`) to match your project's requirements.

- **Browser and Selenium Configuration**:
  - Adjust the `browser` and `selenium-version` matrix variables in the workflow file to customize browser testing capabilities.

## How to run the Robot Suite

# pabot --suitesfrom ./Testcase/ --processes 5 -d ./reports/  -i Test  .

Pabot - It is Command
--suitesfrom - It is Flag used to where the Suite stored
--processes - It is Flag used to how many testcase run parellel
-d - It is Flag used to Once run robot test Publish the Robot Report
-i - It is Flag used to tagging test whenever we want specifi test


## Auto.bat
It contains batch scripting for local execution it supports only windows machine
